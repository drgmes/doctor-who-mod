Doctor Who Mod - is a global mod for Fabric Minecraft inspired by the British series "Doctor Who".

In it, you can get your own **TARDIS** (machine for traveling through time and space) and explore the worlds in search
of adventure and danger.

***
To get a **TARDIS**, you must first buy a TARDIS key from an engineer who lives in the village,
or simply put an engineer table to an unemployed villager.
The next step is to find the **TARDIS** in the Ancient City, or, more rarely, in the Piglin Bastion's treasury.
Oh yeah, and don't forget to buy a repair kit, because your new **TARDIS**... isn't exactly new.

The final step is to equip your **TARDIS** with special systems that give you the ability to fly your spacetime machine.
That's all for now. Enjoy!
